  Aiming at the problems of insufficient real label data, complex time-varying laws, and huge cross-sensor differences in the task of feature classification and mapping of long time-series remote sensing images, this project focuses on the research of “self-supervised pre-training model construction - explicit modeling of temporal characteristics - cross-sensor knowledge feature alignment”.
