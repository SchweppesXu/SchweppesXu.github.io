  The key bottleneck issues that restrict the in-depth application of video remote sensing are insufficient information on complex and weak targets, insufficient mining of spatiotemporal variation characteristics, and unclear revelation of event evolution processes. Therefore, this project intends to systematically develop the theory and methods of video remote sensing information processing based on its characteristics of wide scene, high temporal sequence, and strong complementarity of temporal spatial information.
