  This work presents a CD network (Diffpurifier) for optical and SAR images.Firstly, The optical image is transferred to the SAR image, which is achieved through an algorithm that combines the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) and ordinary differential equations, while extracting multi-scale and multi-time step features. Then, combined with pixel-superpixel correlation to suppress the effect of potential noise, multilevel change detection is performed in a supervised manner. In the experiment, the proposed Diffpurifier was tested on four representative datasets to verify its effectiveness and robustness.
